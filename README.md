# OI-BaseDocumentaire


ASP.NET MVC 5 Intranet site for the glassware company O-I Manufacturing Gironcourt-Sur-Vraine.
I let the base code available for free for any developer who would like a website searching for documents on a server and displaying them in a table view (sortable, with filters, shortcuts and a search bar)

N.B.: I didn't have internet at the office when I coded the site so there's only the minimum commits pushed
